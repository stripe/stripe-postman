See https://stripe.com/docs/api for more details.\n## Prerequisites\n[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)\n\n[Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n## Getting Started\nTo get started fork the collection from [Stripe's public workspace](https://www.postman.com/stripedev/workspace/stripe-developers/overview) within Postman.\n\n![Fork collection](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_collection.png)\n\nEnter a name for your fork and select the workspace where it will be created:\n\n![Fork form](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_form.png)\n\nYou can also fork the environment template from the Stripe Developers Workspace:\n\n![Fork environment template](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_fork_env_template.png)\n\n### Set your API key\nTo run requests you'll need to supply your [testmode secret API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and set it as an [environment variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) within your workspace.\n\nTo set any environment variable, create a new envionment within Postman:\n\n![create a new environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_new_env.png)\n\nAdd your secret key as a variable to the environment and save:\n\n![set API key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_key_and_save.png)\n\nSet the environment to active:\n\n![save as active](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_active_env.png)\n\nNow within the collection set it to use the environment you just created:\n\n![set collection environment](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_collection_environment.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up correctly, you should see your secret key value if you mouse over the `secret_key` variable in the Token field:\n\n![secret key mouseover](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_secret_key_mouseover.png)\n\n\n\nBe sure to save the collection after you've configured the set the key:\n\n![save key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_save_key.png)\n\n## Make a test call\nYou should be ready now to make a test call. An easy first call is to create a customer:\n\n![customer endpoints](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_endpoints.png)\n\nSince no parameters are required to create a customer, you can just hit the Send button to run this request:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_send.png)\n\nIf your environment is set up you'll get a customer object back as the response to the call:\n\n![create customer send](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_customer_create_no_params_response.png)\n\n\nAdd parameters to the call by clicking the body tab, where you'll see a list of available parameters.  Select and populate the ones you want to use. Here's an example of adding an email parameter:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_request.png)\n\nYou'll see the email address in the reponse:\n\n![create customer with email](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_create_customer_with_email_response.png)\n\n## Passing Metadata In a Request\nRight now [metadata](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) does not show up as a optional parameter on requests, but it can still be provided to calls that will accept it.  Here's an example of adding 2 metadata fields to the customer create call:\n\n![set metadata on a request](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_set_metadata.png)\n\nMetadata key value pairs can be updated in a similar manner. To remove a metadata key during an update call, supply the `metadata[key]` parameter without setting a value.  This will pass an empty string as part of the request:\n\n![clear metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_update_metadata.png)\n\nTo remove all metadata pass the `metadata` parameter without a value set:\n\n![remove metadata key](https://raw.github.com/stripe/stripe-postman/master/screenshots/postman_remove_metadata.png)\n\n## Changelog\n\n##

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead.

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead.

You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href=\"/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage\">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together.

Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.\n\n`pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.",

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.\n\nUse `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.\n\nUse `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).\n\nUse `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead.
